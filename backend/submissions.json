    "answer": "One of the core concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages is inheritance. It is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class. Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. \n\nBenefits of inheritance are:\n\nInheritance allows you to inherit the properties of a class, i.e., base class to another, i.e., derived class. The benefits of Inheritance in Python are as follows:\n\nIt represents real-world relationships well.\nIt provides the reusability of a code. We don\u2019t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\nIt is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\nInheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure.
